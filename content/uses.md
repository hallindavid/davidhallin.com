Here's what I'm currently using day-to-day. I'll try to keep this up to date as things change.

## languages & frameworks

* **<a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>** — my primary backend framework. I use it daily at Lumion and for personal projects. It's the foundation of almost everything I build.
* **<a href="https://livewire.laravel.com/">Livewire</a> + <a href="https://filamentphp.com/">Filament</a>** — for building admin panels and interactive UIs within Laravel without reaching for a full SPA.
* **<a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>** — I reach for this when I need performance or when the problem is math-heavy. I've written some neat pieces in it.
* **<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>** — I style everything with Tailwind at this point. Can't imagine going back.
* **<a href="https://alpinejs.dev/">Alpine.js</a>** — lightweight interactivity without the overhead of a full JS framework.
* **<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>** — powers this site. Fast, simple, gets out of the way.

*Previously: Codeigniter, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, vanilla PHP*

## editor & terminal

* **<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>** — my IDE for all real coding work.
* **<a href="https://github.com/kencrocken/FiraCodeiScript">Fira Code iScript</a>** — my go-to font across editors. Ligatures make code easier to scan.
* **<a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a>** — my current terminal. Fast and stays out of the way.
* **<a href="https://tableplus.com/">TablePlus</a>** — database client. Clean interface, handles multiple connections well.

## AI tools

* **<a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> / <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-codex/">Codex</a>** — daily coding companions. These pulled me back into hands-on coding after spending a lot of time in architecture and management mode.
* **<a href="https://www.conductor.build/">Conductor.build</a>** — I use this heavily for running multiple AI coding agents in parallel. It's changed how I approach larger tasks.

## design & planning

* **<a href="https://lucid.co/">Lucid</a> (Lucidchart / Lucidspark)** — I use this heavily. Flowcharts, data-lifecycle diagrams, system design — I almost always start here before writing code.
* **<a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>** — where I journal obsessively using a blend of the PARA method and the Bullet Journal system.

## data

* **<a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> / <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>** — my primary relational databases. I started my career as a DBA, so I'm particular about schemas and query performance.
* **<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a> / <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>** — when document-oriented storage fits the problem better.

*Previously: MSSQL, Firestore*

## infrastructure & hosting

* **<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> + <a href="https://forge.laravel.com/">Laravel Forge</a>** — my go-to for provisioning and managing servers.
* **<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>** — Lambdas and S3, mostly.
* **<a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>** — static hosting. This site runs on it.
* **<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>** — DNS and edge caching.

*Previously: Azure, Google Cloud, Aptum/Peer1, GitHub Pages*

## hardware & OS

* **Mac** — primary machine these days.
* **<a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>** — my browser of choice.

## integrations

* **<a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>** — payments and subscriptions.
* **<a href="https://sendgrid.com/">Sendgrid</a> / <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">Mailgun</a>** — transactional email.
* **<a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>** — SMS.
* **<a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>** — mostly for notifications and integrations.

*Previously: Mapbox, Mapquest, Google Maps, Intercom, Helpscout, Zendesk*

## testing & CI/CD

* **<a href="https://pestphp.com/">PestPHP</a>** — my testing framework for Laravel projects.
* **<a href="https://styleci.io/">StyleCI</a>** — automated code style enforcement.

*Previously: PHPUnit, ChipperCI, CircleCI*
