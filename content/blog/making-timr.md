I almost always have a few projects on the go at a t ime at iApotheca, and then I also usuually have a few side projects I work on as well.

As a developer, I relate strongly to theories like this:

Of course, if you want to improve something, you must measure it.

So I've spent a great deal of time trying to track and optimize my time of the years. 

I've used time trackers like [toggl](https://toggl.com) in the past, but I've always had a hard time remembering to open them up and actually track time through the day.  After building [bash-mission-log](/blog/bash-mission-log) and using it for nearly a year now, I know for me, having something in terminal is the way to go.

I also wanted this one to be a bit more easy to integrate with external services like a database, and potentially in the future integrate with an external display for raspberry pi, or arduino.

So I made [timr](https://github.com/hallindavid/timr) in order to be the time tracking partner for bash-mission-log.


here is a quick preview of what it does:
