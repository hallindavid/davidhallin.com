Well - I just used Jigsaw to build this site.  I started at 6:30 AM, and at the time of writing, it's 7:28 AM on March 25th, 2020.  

If you're already comfortable with Laravel, <a href="https://jigsaw.tighten.co">Jigsaw</a> is by far the easiest static-site generation tool I've played with so far - I've tried a few like Gatsby, and Nuxt, and I think they are awesome, but if you're a PHP dev at heart, Jigsaw is goign to be an easier go for you.

This website (davidhallin.com) is totally open-source.  You can take a look at the repo here <a href="https://github.com/hallindavid/davidhallin" target="_blank()">github.com/hallindavid/davidhallin</a>

I pushed this website to GitHub pages - which is free hosting for static websites that are open-source. 

For **just 1 hour of work** I think it's pretty decent to have a blog themed, all the basic info added, and pushed to production hosting with SSL.
