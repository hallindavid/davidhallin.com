# observations

<br />
**I lasted 2 weeks before switching back to my pixel**

The process was interesting... there were 2 things that ultimately yanked me back to my pixel.

**camera**

First is the camera - the flip phone doesn't have a camera that's worth talking about.  Since I've had a smart phone for... I guess a bit over a decade now, there are a few deep habits that I use my camera for, things like

<ul style="margin-left:15px">
    <li>
        scanning receipts so I don't need to carry them around after a business purchase
    </li>
    <li>
        documenting events like (recently) the specification of the tire for our car
    </li>
    <li>
        scanning ephemeral documents like grocery lists, or weekly schedules
    </li>
</ul>
<br />

These things became a bit important during the past few weeks as we did a lot of moving things around in the house.

**family**

The other reason is family.  Somewhere between 5 and 10 years ago, my siblings, parents and I were very spread out.  One of my sisters lived in the UK, I lived in Ontario, and my parents and other sister lived in Alberta.  We created a family habit of using WhatsApp to avoid the international SMS fees.  When I was using the flip phone, I missed out on some family communication that I want to be a part of.


In spite of these two inconveniences, there was some really positive things that came from this expirement.

If you've read books like Cal Newport's _Deep Work_ or _Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World_, this won't come as a suprise. 

**my smartphone does very little to enrich my life.**

To take that thought a bit further, there are about 50 apps that have lived on my phone in recent months.  Since doing this experiment, I have deleted most of them.

I will detail a few things that are of interest.


First, there are a bunch of apps on my phone that send me notifications that I don't actually use.  I would get notifications like these:
- [insert some random person] tweeted "[insert some social or political upsetting quote here]"
- Your picture "20210904-PXL-ASDF1234.png has uploaded successfully
- The world is even more fucked than it was yesterday - Tap here to read more!

<br />
Some notifications are *actively* irritating, others are useless, but few to none of them help me accomplish anything.

Moving to the flip phone disconnected me from a lot of these things enough to notice the negative impacts.

Notifications are distracting, and it gives someone else permission to ste my schedule.  When Twitter sends me a notification, it's like they're saying "Hey, we own the next 20 minutes of your life" and if I tap the notification, I'm saying "Ok - I'll move my schedule around to suit your plans."

I actually enjoy using Twitter, and it helps me with my career because it keeps in in the loop about industry specific opinions and news, but I want to set the schedule.

The other thing that I noticed was when I had time to burn, like waiting for laundry, I would sit down, and open an app.  The next thing I know, it's been two hours, and the schedule I made for my day has gone out the window.

Using the flip phone for the short time I did, made it easy to arrange my time better, and ultimately make me happier.

# conclusion

**my phone felt like an extension of me before this expirement.  leaving it in a different room, or forgetting it at home was a reason to turn around**

I downloaded a new launcher called [indistractable](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.indistractablelauncher.android&hl=en_US&gl=US) which I think delivers on their ideology.

Here is the ideology section from their play store description.

ðŸ’¡ Ideology:

* Indistractable Launcher is inspired by The light phone.
* Focus on what matters - only the core apps you really need
* Keep it simple
* Inspired by Atomic Habits by James Clear, Deep Work by Cal Newport and of course Indistractable by Nir Eyal

I also ended up deleting all of the apps on my phone, except for a very select few, and the only ones that notify me now are phone and messages, and those only notify me when I turn do-not-disturb mode off.

My cloud services, like Twitter, or Reddit only get my attention when I'm on my computer, when I choose to browse to them.

Now the phone feels much less like an extension of my arm, and feels more like a tool that you really only pick up when you need to use it.
