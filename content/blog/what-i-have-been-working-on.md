It's been a busy few months for me, and I've been super absent from my blog.

I thought I'd do a quick mini-update to tell you what I've been doing, and then I'll probably push out a few posts over the new few days as well to go over it too.

- After Alpine Day ([https://alpineday.com](https://alpineday.com/) ) I picked up a whittling kit from amazon, and carved my first spoon.

- Rachelle bought me a viking model ship for Christmas actually 2 years back, and I've been working on that here and there.  I have made a few customizations on my desk to manage both my programming work, and my mini-carpentry stuff.

- At iApotheca, we brought on a new developer who has restored my interest in Linux, so after around 9 years of being a Mac OS user, I've basically moved to Linux, and this came with a variety of challenges about how to do what I do on mac, but with Linux.  This change resulted in a new PC, and quite a bit of mini workflow adjustments, so I'll probably have a few posts about that in the next few weeks.
- Lots of reading
- Playing with Arduino, I have a nifty project that I'll release the source code & plans for once I'm finished with it and know it works the way I want it to.
