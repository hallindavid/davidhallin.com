It's been a busy few months for me, and I've been super absent from my blog.

I thought I'd do a quick mini-update to tell you what I've been doing, and then I'll probably push out a few posts over the new few days as well to go over it too.

- After [AlpineDay](https://alpineday.com/) I picked up a whittling kit from amazon, and carved my first spoon.

- Rachelle bought me a viking model ship for Christmas, and I've been working on that here and there.  I have made a few customizations on my desk to manage both my programming work, and my mini-carpentry stuff.
- few images of viking ship
- At iApotheca, we brought on a new developer, and he's a linux fan, so after working on mac around 9 years, I'm back on Linux.  This change resulted in a new PC, and quite a bit of mini workflow optimizations, so I'll probably have a few posts about that in the next few weeks.

- Lots of reading
- Playing with Arduino - have a kind of cool project that I'll release the source code & plans for once I'm done.
