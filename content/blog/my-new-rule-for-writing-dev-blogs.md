Personally, I don't find it compelling reading dev blog posts that follow these patterns

- "I had a problem, so I asked a question, and this person had an answer that was ...."
- "I saw something on twitter, and thought it looked interesting so i followed the link and this is what I found ..."

But I find myself accidentally writing them all the time.

I often take notes using bullet points, and when I flush out the idea a bit more, sometimes there's not a lot of content.  

I try to make it into more of a story, rather than a paragraph and a solution, but sometimes it's better to be short and sweet.

So my new, slightly more quantitative rule will be: 

**Don't make a post with more context than content**
