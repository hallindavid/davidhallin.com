I haven’t learned this much, this fast since I first began using Laravel.

I’ve been working professionally as a Laravel developer for a long time, but with the rapid advancement of AI, it’s getting harder to ignore how much it’s changing the way I approach my work.

It isn't just writing code faster, it's taking a different approach to it altogether.

Tools that have been around for years — like git worktrees — suddenly seem useful in AI workflows. New ideas like vibe-coding and multi-agent orchestration are forcing me to rethink how I structure projects entirely.

It feels like being a beginner again- in a good way.

Over the next few weeks, I've got a ton of things on my mind to write about, but here are a quick few that I've already started scoping out

**Workflow**
- Git worktrees
- Writing better PRDs for Claude

**AI Orchestration**
- Multi-agent setups
- Codex vs Claude for different tasks

**Technical Deep Dives**
- Some wild MySQL discoveries

**Personal Systems**
- How AI has reshaped my journaling process

There’s something new to experiment with almost every day. And honestly, I haven’t been this energized about development in years.
